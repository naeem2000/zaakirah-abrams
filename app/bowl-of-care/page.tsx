					<h2>about the project </h2>
					<p>
						<span>Bowl Of Care</span>Â is a project that was created as part of a
						college project with the primary goal of developing a food delivery
						application. However, we sought to elevate its purpose by
						considering individuals facing food insecurity or reliant on food
						stamps. Through our emphasis on creating a user-friendly design, we
						seamlessly integrated features into the app, ensuring effortless
						access for all users to order nutritious meals.
